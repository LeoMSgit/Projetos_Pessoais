Build a model that predicts the S&P 500 index based on the prices of 500 stocks. 

The training data consists of 4000 samples, each with 500 stock prices and the corresponding S&P 500 index value. 

The test data consists of 1000 samples, each with 500 stock prices, and we need to predict the S&P 500 index for each of these samples.
